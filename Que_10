What is a Promise in JavaScript and how does it work? 
Explain the states of a Promise. 
Explain how to chain multiple Promises together and the syntax for doing so.

Answer:  Promise is used to handle an asynchronous function and its resulting value.

Promise has three states: -
1) Pending
2) Accepted 
3) Rejected

Pending: When we are waiting for the asynchronous function to execute.
Accepted: The function has been executed and promise gets resolved.
Rejected: The function hasn't been executed due to an error or some other reasons leading to rejection of the promise.

To perform promise chaining we can use multiple then blocks with a promise and followed by a catch block to handled any type of error in any of the then() block.
